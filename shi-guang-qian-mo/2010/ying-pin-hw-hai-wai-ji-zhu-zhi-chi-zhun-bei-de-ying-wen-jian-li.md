Interview English
Good afternoon !
It is really my honor to have this opportunity for a interview, I hope I can make a good performance today.
Now I will introduce myself briefly. I am 26 years old, born in Shaanxi Province. I was graduated from Hebei University of Engineering. My major is automation, and I got my bachelor degree after my graduation in the year of 2007.
I spend most of my time on study, I have passed CET4(College English Test), and I have acquired basic knowledge of my major during my school time.
In July 2007, I begin work for Zhuhai Founder PCB manufacturing company as an equipment assistant engineer. After a three-month probationary period, I recognized that employment objective of the job is incompatible with my career objective, and mostly we are idling in the workshop, so I decided to change my job and resigned in November 2007.
And in December 2007,I left Zhuhai to Xi’an and worked for a private company as a hardware development engineer. My duty is to improve the product stability by using many hardware and software tools. Two years of embedded hardware and software development experience make me familiar with embedded system developing. It is a good job, but not a good career. I feel I have reached the "glass ceiling" in my current job, and there is no opportunity for advancement. So I want to change my working environment, I'd like to find a job which is more challenging.
HuaWei is a global company, so I feel I can gain the most from working in this kind of company environment. That is the reason why I come here to compete for this position.
I think I'm a good team player and I'm a person of great honesty to others. Also I am able to work under great pressure.
That’s all. Thank you for giving me the chance.
